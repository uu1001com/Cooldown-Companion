## New Features

- **Texture panels:** A brand-new panel type that displays spell and aura effects as standalone visual indicators anywhere on your screen. Comes with drag positioning, nudge controls, rotation, stretch, opacity, and bounce/shrink animations. Includes a built-in texture picker with curated Blizzard textures, a proc overlay browser, and support for custom texture paths. Everything previews live in the config.

- **Cast bar vertical offset:** When panel anchoring is active for both resources and the cast bar, cast bars now have their own independent vertical offset slider, so you can position the cast bar separately from the rest of the icon group.

- **New standalone aura desaturation toggles:** Reworked the old `Saturate while Aura Active` toggle into 2 new muturally exclusive toggles: `Invert Desaturation Logic` and `Never Desaturate` for more fine-tuned control. Only applies to standalone aura entries.

## Polish | QoL

- **Panel type dropdown:** Extra panel types are now organized in a compact dropdown instead of separate buttons.
- **Empty panel guidance:** The panel list now shows helpful guidance text when no panels exist yet.
- **Aura tracking tooltip rewrite:** The aura tracking tooltip now shows structured setup requirements, supported capabilities, and limitations instead of a brief warning.
- **Stable config columns:** Button settings now always appear in Column 3 and panel/group settings always in Column 4.
- **Custom aura bar alpha controls:** Independently anchored custom aura bars now have their own Alpha tab.
- **Config tooltips:** Hold Shift while hovering over entries in Column 2 to see their tooltips. Also works for entries seen via Auto-Add in Column 3.
- **Smaller export strings:** Export strings are now significantly more compact, producing shorter share codes. Importing older strings still works as before.
- **Simplified group positioning:** Removed the old Anchor to Frame, Anchor Point, and Relative Point controls from group layout settings. Groups now use simple screen offsets for positioning. Panel settings continue to maintain their Anchor-to-Frame settings.

## Bug Fixes

- **Stacks layout preview not refreshing:** The layout preview now updates immediately when you change max stack settings.
- **Single aura stacks in text mode:** Auras with a single stack now show the stack count in text mode, matching multi-stack auras.

## New Features

- **Custom keybind text:** Icon buttons now support custom keybind text, letting you override what's shown in the keybind corner of any icon.

## Polish | QoL

- **Drag and Drop 2.0:** A top-to-bottom overhaul of drag-and-drop across the config, with animated previews and smarter drop targeting.
  - **Column 1 drag-and-drop:** Sections, folders, and unloaded spells can now be reordered with refined drop targets and stable previews.
  - **Column 2 drag-and-drop:** Panels now animate smoothly as you drag, with cleaner gap placement and preview opacity.
  - **Resource bar layout and order:** Attached resource bars now support mirrored drag-and-drop reordering with a dedicated layout preview.
  - ! **The browse other characters toggle has been moved to top right button cluster to accomodate the new drag-and-drop system**

- **Column 1 onboarding:** First-time group setup and empty sections now show friendly placeholder text instead of being empty, with proper text wrapping in Column 1.

## Bug Fixes

- **Astral Power on non-Balance specs:** Astral Power is now hidden for druids that are not in their Balance spec.

## Bug Fixes

- **Badge Lua Fix:** Disabled panel headers in the config view should now keep their own status badge correctly instead of sharing or losing it when the list refreshes.

## New Features

- **Built-in changelog viewer:** You can now open bundled release notes directly from the config panel, browse older versions, and adjust the viewer text size for easier reading.

## Polish | QoL

- **Aura unit selection for tracked spells:** Aura-tracked spells can now explicitly watch either your Player or Target auras, making buff and debuff tracking easier to set up when the default target is not the one you want.
  - ! *Please double-check any entries that attach auras to spells to make sure the selected target is correct. This change was needed to help protect aura tracking from reading the wrong duration.*

- **Clearer aura tracking setup:** Aura tracking now gives more direct active or inactive feedback, clearer guidance when Blizzard Cooldown Manager setup is missing, and cleaner labels in the spell settings panel.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed inconsistent count text behavior:** Supported icon and bar count text should now behave more consistently instead of mixing charge-style and other count displays in the wrong situations.

- **Whirling Dragon Punch fix:** Whirling Dragon Punch now supports the unusable-state toggle so it can follow the same visibility and dimming rules as other supported buttons.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed false cooldown states after empowered casts:** Spells should no longer briefly dim, hide, or act like they are on cooldown when an empowered cast is released and enters its recovery window.
- **Fixed config help tooltip taint errors:** Hovering info buttons in the config should now avoid the tooltip sizing taint errors that could fire while reading help text.

## New Features

- **Animated custom aura bar indicators:** Custom aura bars can now show when an aura is active or in pandemic range, with optional pulse and color-shift effects to make those states easier to spot at a glance.
- **Multiline text panels:** Text panel formats can now span multiple lines, including a line break token in the format editor so you can build stacked text layouts more easily.

## Polish | QoL

- **Better bar effect previews:** Active-aura and pandemic preview buttons now give a fuller, more reliable preview of custom aura bar effects at both the group and per-button level.
- **More dependable text formatting:** Text panel formatting now handles keybind conditionals and fallback text more consistently, making advanced formats behave more predictably.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed multiline text sizing:** Multiline text panels and per-button multiline overrides now size themselves more reliably, reducing clipping and layout issues.
- **Fixed aura-only status text edge cases:** Aura-only text displays now report timeless buffs more cleanly and handle combat aura timers with more reliable sizing and classification.
